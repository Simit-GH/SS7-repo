PRACTICAL 2 Cryptool

Aim -Use CrypTool for encryption and decryption of strings in various algorithms.

Thoery : 

CrypTool is an open-source project that focuses on the free e-learning software CrypTool illustrating cryptographic and cryptanalytic concepts. According to "Hakin9", CrypTool is worldwide the most widespread e-learning software in the field 
of cryptology.
CrypTool implements more than 400 algorithms. Users can adjust these with own parameters. To introduce users to the field of cryptography, the organization created multiple graphical 
interface software containing an online documentation, analytic tools and algorithms. They contain most classical ciphers, as 
well as modern symmetric and asymmetric cryptography including RSA, ECC, digital signatures, hybrid encryption, homomorphic encryption, and Diffie?Hellman key exchange. 
Methods from the area of quantum cryptography (like BB84 key 
exchange protocol) and the area of post-quantum cryptography 
(like McEliece, WOTS, Merkle-Signature-Scheme, XMSS, 
XMSS_MT, and SPHINCS) are implemented. In addition to the 
algorithms, solvers (analyzers) are included, especially for 
classical ciphers. Other methods (for instance Huffman code, 
AES, Keccak, MSS) are visualized. 
In addition it contains: didactical games (like Number Shark, 
Divider Game, or Zudo-Ku) and interactive tutorials about primes, elementary number theory, and lattice-based 
cryptography. 

Steps : 

1. Install CrypTool . 

2.Open this tool and create txt file and type input or plain text. 

3.click on Encrypt/Decrypt then click specific cipher algorithm and enter key values for performing that specified algorithm. 

4.Press on encrypt button and it will display encrypted plain text. 

5.Now if want to decrypt it do the same process as done for encryption.

PRACTICAL 3 Networking Commands

Aim: Use the commands ipconfig, ping, netstat and traceroute to analyze their outputs.

Execute the following set of queries/commands

Theory:-

1. ifconfig:
 internet protocol configuration 
Displays all current TCP/IP network configuration values and refreshes Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Domain Name System (DNS) settings. Used without parameters, ipconfig displays Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and IPv6 
addresses, subnet mask, and default gateway for all adapters.

Command:-
ifconfig (Linux)
ipconfig (Windows)

2.Ping: 
Ping is a computer network administration software utility used to test the reachability of a host on an Internet Protocol network. 
It is available for virtually all operating systems that have networking capability, including most embedded network administration software.

Command:-
ping 8.8.8.8

3.Netstat: 
The network statistics ( netstat ) command is a networking tool 
used for troubleshooting and configuration, that can also serve 
as a monitoring tool for connections over the network. Both 
incoming and outgoing connections, routing tables, port listening, 
and usage statistics are common uses for this command.

Command:-
netstat

4.Traceroute: 
Traceroute is a network diagnostic tool used to 
track in real-time the pathway taken by a packet on an IP 
network from source to destination, reporting the IP addresses 
of all the routers it pinged in between. Traceroute also records 
the time taken for each hop the packet makes during its route to 
the destination.

Command:-
traceroute/
tracert 8.8.8.8 (Google)
tracert fb.com

PRACTICAL 4

Aim:- Use NMap scanner to perform scanning on ports of various websites.

Theory/Output :

ACK 

It never determines open (or even open|filtered)ports.It is used 
to map out firewall rulesets,determining whether they are 
stateful or not and which ports are filtered.

Command - 
nmap -sA -T4 scanme.nmap.org

SYN :-
SYN scan is the default and most popular scan option for good 
reason. It can be performed quickly, scanning thousands of 
ports per second on a fast network not hampered by intrusive 
firewalls. SYN scan is relatively unobtrusive and stealthy, since it 
never completes TCP connections.

Command :-
nmap -p 22,113,139 scanme.nmap.org

NULL :-
Does not set any bits (TCP flag header is 0)
Command :-
nmap -sN -p 22 scanme.nmap.org

PRACTICAL 5 Wireshark TooL

Aim:-Use Wireshark tool to perform data packet sniffing on your network.

Theory:- Wireshark is the world's leading network traffic analyzer, and an essential tool for any security professional or systems administrator. This free software lets you analyze 
network traffic in real time, and is often the best tool for 
troubleshooting issues on your network.

Steps: 
1) Open the Wireshark.
2) connect to WIFI.
3) see the analysis of the time, source, destination, protocol, 
length and info.
4) Then after that write the ip address of your WIFI in filter 
ip, clk enter and then see the devices ip address connected to ur 
WIFI.
5) After that go to Google and search any site and surf on the 
same page for 1-2 second and then come back to Wireshark and 
check in the down table that the name is visible or not.

Command Example:-

ip.src==192.168.1.2

PRACTICAL 6 Network Shell (netsh)

Aim- Password detection network shell.

Theory:-

1.netsh is a command-line scripting utility that allows you to 
display or modify the network configuration of a computer that is 
currently running.
2. Type in the following command in Command Prompt and press the Enter key:

Command:-
netsh wlan show profiles

3. All the Wi-Fi networks you?ve accessed in the past will appear.
4. To find a password for one of the profiles listed enter in:

Command:-
netsh wlan show profile name=profilename key=clear

For example, we want to see further details about CloudBT-
Guest. You would enter in?

Command:-
netsh wlan show profile name=CloudBT-Guest key=clear

Steps:-
1.Open command prompt.
2.Enter the command netsh wlan show profile in command 
prompt.
3.Enter the command 

netsh wlan export profile folder=C:\
key=clear and

netsh wlan show profile name="your wifi name" 
key=clear 

in the command prompt.

PRACTICAL 7 Denial Of Service Attack using batch file

Aim:-Execute a DOS attack using bat file and on your command prompt.

Theory:-

1.A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is an attack meant to shut down a machine or network, making it inaccessible to its intended users.
2.DoS attacks accomplish this by flooding the target with traffic, or sending it information that triggers acrash.
3.In both instances, the DoS attack deprives legitimate users (i.e. 
employees, members, or account holders) of the service or 
resource they expected.

Steps:-
1.Open Notepad write following program.
2.save with .bat extension and for save as type choose all the 
files .
3. run the bat file .

batch file CODE:-

index.bat
:loop
ping 192.168.1.112 -w 1 -n 1
goto :loop

Run the above code in CMD to perform DoS attack.

PRACTICAL 8 Keylogger Attack

Aim : Create a simple keylogger using python.

Theory :

Keylogging is a method that was first imagined back in the year 1983.
Keylogger is a software that records each and every keystroke you enter, including mouse clicks. Hardware keyloggers are also available which will be inserted between keyboard and CPU.

It provides the following features:
It takes a minute to install this software/hardware in the victim?s 
system, from the next second onwards attacker will get every 
activity going on in the victim computer.
Each and every activity happening in the victim?s system with 
screenshots will be recorded.
This activity will be saved in the victim?s system or it can be 
mailed to the attacker email or can be uploaded to the FTP 
server.
It works watchfully, escaped the client?s view, for example, the 
focused on the client could never discover that all his keystrokes 
are being recorded.
Keyloggers recorder can record writings, email, and any 
information you compose at whatever point using your support.
